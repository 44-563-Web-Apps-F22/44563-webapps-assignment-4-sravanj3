  <h5 class="CHO">CHO:</h5>           <p class="song">Towards the empyrean heights
                          Of ev'ry kind of lore,
                    We've taken several easy flights,
                          And mean to take some more.
                    In trying to achieve success
                          No envy racks our heart,
                    And all the knowledge we possess,
                          We mutually impart.

                                  SOLO — Melissa

                    Pray, what authors should she read
                    Who in Classics would succeed?

                                  SOLO — Psyche

                    If you'd climb the Helicon,
                    You should read Anacreon,
                    Ovid's Metamorphoses,
                    Likewise Aristophanes,
                    And the works of Juvenal:
                    These are worth attention, all;
                    But, if you will be advised,
                    You will get them Bowdlerized!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
  <h5 class="CHO">CHO:</h5>           <p class="song">Ah! we will get them Bowdlerized!

                                SOLO — Sacharissa

                    Pray you, tell us, if you can,
                    What's the thing that's known as Man?

                                  SOLO — Psyche

                    Man will swear and man will storm—
                    Man is not at all good form—
                    Is of no kind of use—
                    Man's a donkey — Man's a goose—
                    Man is coarse and Man is plain—
                    Man is more or less insane—
                    Man's a ribald — Man's a rake,
                    Man is Nature's sole mistake!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
  <h5 class="CHO">CHO:</h5>           <p class="song">We'll a memorandum make—
                    Man is Nature's sole mistake!

                    And thus to empyrean height
                          Of ev'ry kind of lore,
                    In search of wisdom's pure delight,
                          Ambitiously we soar.
                    In trying to achieve success
                          No envy racks our heart,
                    For all we know and all we guess
                          We mutually impart!
                    And all the knowledge we possess,
                          We mutually impart,
                          We mutually impart, impart.</p>
